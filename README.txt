HOW TO PLAY:

ABOUT:
I wanted to make a graphical stealth roguelike that had the semi-realtime
gameplay of games like Red Rogue in Dogmatic mode.


THE ENEMIES:
Guards randomly wander around. If they see you, they will shoot you and attempt
to chase you down! Upon sight of you or a dead body they also become much more
alert and run around the level much faster to try to catch you.

Have fun!
