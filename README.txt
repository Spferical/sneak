ABOUT:
I wanted to make a graphical stealth roguelike that had the semi-realtime
gameplay of games like Red Rogue in Dogmatic mode.

You are an assassin who is supposed to kill the bright green [T]arget and
escape back through the [<] stairs you came from. Avoid the guards and perhaps
find some items which are of use along the way.

THE ENEMIES:
Guards randomly wander around. If they see you, they will shoot you and attempt
to chase you down! Upon sight of you or a dead body they also become much more
alert and run around the level much faster to try to catch you.

Have fun!
